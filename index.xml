      <description>Statistic analysis is one of the most important approach in order to optimize bioprocesses. In this web application we have integrated some statistical tools tools to automatize the analysis of bioprocesses, such as t-test, ANOVA and Surface Response Analysis. The user can choose between different types of linear regression models, the variables to analize and download the results once the calculations has been made.

      <description>This wep application allows the user to simulate different types of kinetic models in a lote type bioreactor. The models that have been considered here are some of the most popular and useful models used in fermentation modelling. Through the use of Genetic Algorithms, it is possible to find the kinetic parameters once the user has entered his data. Because GA are global optimization techniques, the user can be sure about the validity of the kinetics paramets he obtains.</description>
